# ballet-jumps
Classify 3 ballet jumps using Machine learning and data collected from a SensorTile used as wearable device on one ankle.
The code was created by: Ana Boburg Nystedt and Allyson Bieryla using "pair programming" through Zoom.  
Even though only one person uploaded the files into Github, we both made essencial contributions to the source code. We decided to do it like this to simplify the use of GitHub to a beginner user.
